Must have HostTheBest's free Close Account addon installed and have the "Inactive after" set (if you set the "Close after" to anything other than 0 then it will negate this hook but will close all accounts that do not have active services). http://www.hostthebest.com/closeaccount.php

//Installation:
1) Upload the closefraud.php file into your WHMCS's hooks directory (/includes/hooks/).
